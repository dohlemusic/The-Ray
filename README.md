# What is the Ray?
When we designed the Ray, we wanted that huge dynamic range and detail of 12AX7 tube you can find in some Fender amps, but in a compact form factor, without building an actual tube into the pedal. We are proud to announce that we did it! We made a unique sounding pedal that offers a very similar tonal characteristics and dynamics to big tube combos, in a tiny package! Pluck the strings delicately, and you will hear the sound of your guitar, nearly unaltered, with that discrete warmth of a tube. Now pluck the strings harder and you can hear a beautiful heavy, yet detailed fuzz of a big old combo!

# What’s inside the Ray?
The pedal is fully analog and sports a subcircuit known as a Fetzer valve. Thanks to a carefully selected JFET transistor (J201) and precisely tuned biasing and capacitors, you can now enjoy a tube sound in a modern form factor. Now, the transistor alone wasn’t enough to push the pedal all the way to fuzz, so we push it with a high quality NE5532 low noise op-amp which gained quite a renown for its sound in audiophile community for its tonal properties and great sound. If you want to know more about the inner workings of this pedal, you can read our blog.

# Why the Ray?
Most fuzz or distortion pedals like the RAT rely on diodes to produce clipping, which in turn results in a very compressed sound that lacks detail and the original tone of your guitar. Ray stands out from the crowd thanks to its ability to produce a very broad dynamic range. This means that when you pluck the strings of your guitar delicately, the tone of your guitar remains almost unaltered, with a little warmth of a tube added. However, if you play the strings harder, you start hearing the warm fuzziness. Even cranked up to the maximum, the now aggressive sound produced by this pedal has very little compression and through the heavy fuzz you can still hear a lot of the original tonal value of your guitar. This is exactly what makes this pedal so unique.

# How to use the Ray
Thanks to the two knobs – V and D (Volume and Drive, respectively), you can control the op-amp gain and JFET gain individually. This means you can create a rich gamut of sounds ranging from pure undistorted boost, through pure JFET boost which has harmonic richness of a vacuum tube, or crank both knobs to the maximum and enjoy a warm fuzz of a big old combo! If you want an even heavier tone, you can toggle the presence switch for that extra fat sound!
